/// the columns together and clipped to the viewport. On Uno's Skia renderer (6.7) a frame walks EVERY visual in the
/// tree and computes a clip and damage path for each one (<c>Visual.Render</c>, <c>TryGetPaintDamageRegion</c>); it
/// does not skip a visual that lies wholly outside its clip. A 177-column table therefore paid for ~1,239 cells and
/// their template parts on every frame while 15 of its columns were on screen: 0.3-1.5 s per frame on a desktop,
/// 8-10 s to swap the grid out (measured in Datgel Hub, DH-2215).</para>
/// <para>The renderer DOES skip a visual whose opacity is 0, with its whole subtree (<c>IsRenderSuppressed</c>), and
/// opacity is not a layout property. So an off-screen cell is given opacity 0 and keeps its size and position: the
/// panel measures and arranges exactly as before, a column resize or a scroll re-runs the same arrange, and the cell
/// is given back its own opacity (the local value is cleared) as soon as any part of it comes within
/// <see cref="Margin"/> of the viewport.</para>
/// <para>WinAppSDK's compositor culls clipped content on its own, so there this saves little; it runs on every
/// platform anyway, so there is one code path and the library's own (WinAppSDK) tests exercise it.</para>
